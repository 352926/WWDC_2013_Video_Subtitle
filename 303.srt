00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:15.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi and welcome to Integrating
Passbook into your Ecosystem.

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:18.676 A:middle
My name is Joelle Lam,
an Engineering Manager

00:00:18.676 --> 00:00:22.736 A:middle
at the Apple Store App Team,
also the Engineering Lead

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:26.436 A:middle
of Apple Store Gift Card
in Passbook from WWDC

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:28.696 A:middle
to its launch in October.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:33.746 A:middle
Last year iOS 6 announced
Passbook.

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:37.756 A:middle
Passbook was this way you can
include your boarding passes,

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:42.566 A:middle
your movie tickets and more on
your iPhone or your iPod Touch.

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:48.086 A:middle
Now, us being the Apple
Store Engineering Team,

00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:52.616 A:middle
we knew we wanted to be part of
this, we knew we were missing

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:56.196 A:middle
out if we didn't get involved
in the Passbook Ecosystem.

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:03.006 A:middle
So, very quickly came Apple
Store Gift Card in Passbook.

So, very quickly came Apple
Store Gift Card in Passbook.

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:07.496 A:middle
Now, I'm not from
the Passbook Team.

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:10.776 A:middle
If anything I'm more
like you, I sat there

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:12.506 A:middle
and watched the WWDC sessions,

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.816 A:middle
I'm like an external
developer looking

00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:18.986 A:middle
onto iOS technologies asking,

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:22.296 A:middle
"How do I enrich
the user experience?

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:26.436 A:middle
How do I bring to life
some everyday things,

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.596 A:middle
these everyday things that
used to exist in our pockets?"

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:33.986 A:middle
OK. So, let's do
a quick overview.

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:37.936 A:middle
We're first going to talk
about Apple Store Gift Card,

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.576 A:middle
this is all about
pulling back that curtain

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.106 A:middle
and showing you a little bit

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:44.446 A:middle
about what we did
and why we did it.

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:48.316 A:middle
Then we'll go into
leveraging existing systems.

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:53.376 A:middle
I thought this was so important
because some of you guys are

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:57.766 A:middle
out there, you have these huge
systems and you're wondering,

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:00.546 A:middle
"Can I bring Passbook
to my Ecosystem?"

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:00.546 A:middle
"Can I bring Passbook
to my Ecosystem?"

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:05.936 A:middle
You have ASP downstream, how
many weeks do I have to prepare

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.596 A:middle
for it, to talk to a DVA just

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:10.126 A:middle
to get a database
let alone 3, right?

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:15.576 A:middle
And then I have to do security
review just to get the ACLs

00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:19.206 A:middle
to talk to my security
systems or talk to my services.

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:24.406 A:middle
So, leveraging existing systems
is all about bringing Passbook

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:28.426 A:middle
to your Ecosystem no
matter how complex it is.

00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:32.666 A:middle
Then we'll talk about
determining complexity.

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:38.186 A:middle
This is kind of an experience of
wisdom of what we think it talks

00:02:38.186 --> 00:02:41.336 A:middle
to determine the level of
effort to build your pass.

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:46.136 A:middle
And finally, we'll do some
web services tips and tricks.

00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:49.456 A:middle
These tips and tricks are kind
of separated by complexity level

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:52.006 A:middle
so they'll be something
there a lot of good meat

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:53.976 A:middle
but something there for
every single one of you guys.

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:59.026 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:03.156 A:middle
Apple Store Gift Card is all
about giving the people you care

00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:03.156 A:middle
Apple Store Gift Card is all
about giving the people you care

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:05.246 A:middle
about the products
you love, right?

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:09.466 A:middle
If you look at this life cycle

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:13.466 A:middle
of our gift card somebody
will go into the app

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:16.426 A:middle
or on the website and
they'll purchase a gift card

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:21.996 A:middle
and this gift card will then
get emailed to the giftee.

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:24.806 A:middle
So, when we're delivering
that card,

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:27.706 A:middle
we're actually delivering
an email with a link in it

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:31.676 A:middle
which allows that person, the
giftee, to receive that card.

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:34.826 A:middle
Finally, that card is
open to the Passbook

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:37.336 A:middle
and the user can
look at the pass.

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:42.156 A:middle
From there the Passbook can--
the gift card can be brought

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:45.536 A:middle
into a store used
online and redeemed.

00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:47.916 A:middle
You can use it to
purchase something.

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:51.076 A:middle
And if immediately when
that purchase occurs,

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:55.496 A:middle
we send an update and the update
will actually update the path

00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:59.056 A:middle
and the giftee can now see
their new value in the pass.

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:01.636 A:middle
Of course if they
have a value left,
